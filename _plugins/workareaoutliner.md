## Description

## Description
This plugin adds an "Outline WA" button to preview the working area of a Gcode file.

If using a supported slicer program, this plugin can read the work area from the file's metadata.

If there is no bounding box in the gcode metadata or if you're using an unsupported slicer, WorkAreaOutliner will use OctoPrint's gcode interpreter to analyze the file.

### Supported Slicers:
- PrusaSlicer
- SuperSlicer
- Slic3r
- Lightburn (inherited from OctoPrint-Framer, untested)
- Fusion360 (inherited from OctoPrint-Framer, untested)

## Setup
### Installation
Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html) or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/kforth/OctoPrint-WorkAreaOutliner/archive/master.zip

## Usage
### Configuration
After installation, restart OctoPrint and go to the Settings tab to configure the plugin.

### Outline Function
- Connect to the machine
- Home the machine (or set origin manually)
- Load the Gcode file
- Navigate to the 'Control' tab and click the 'Outline WA' button
- Watch the machine as it outlines the bounding box of the work area
  - Be ready to stop the machine to avoid colisions!
